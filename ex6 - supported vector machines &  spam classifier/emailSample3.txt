Hello ECS! I hope that you are well. 

Next year ECS will celebrate its 75th Anniversary. We will hold a series of events throughout the year.

It is my pleasure to announce a competition for a sign/ a symbol/ art work that we could use to promote the events. This will be separate from an official University logo which we will use alongside the winning designs. 

Please submit your designs to dask1n11@soton.ac.uk by 12:00 noon on Monday, 20 September 2021. Feel free to use any technique that you wish. 

With best wishes,

Dorota
